# backlog_issues_test.sh — tests for `backlog.sh issues`.
#
# The whole point of the design under test is that deciding *what* to do is
# separable from doing it. The planner reads BACKLOG.md and a snapshot of the
# issues that already exist, and prints a plan; only `--apply` then talks to
# GitHub. That makes the interesting half — which items become issues, which get
# closed, which are left alone — assertable without a network call and without
# creating anything on a public repository.
#
# A sync that gets this wrong is not a cosmetic problem: it either opens a
# duplicate issue for every item on every push, or closes issues for work that is
# still open.
#
# POSIX sh and awk only, like the rest of scripts/.
